# ridge_active_learning
A short program to learn different types of regularization techniques.

# Introduction
This project aimed to implement different techniques of regularization given an arbitrary input setting of regulariation parameter:

- l2-regularized least squares linear regression (Ridge regression).

- l1-regularized least squares linear regression (Lasso regression).

- Elastic net regularization (combination of Ridge and Lasso regularizations)

- active learning procedure
